# How to Use

To use the IntelliGeo plugin, you need access to a large language model (LLM) via an API. Currently, we support both [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Cohere](https://cohere.com/). Based on our experience, OpenAI models perform better but require a paid plan. Cohere, while offering free access to their API, delivers slightly lower performance compared to OpenAI.

## OpenAI Guide

### Step 1: Sign Up

Register for ChatGPT at [OpenAI Signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch). You can sign up using an email address or an existing Google, Microsoft, or Apple account.

### Step 2: Open the Dashboard

Once registered, navigate to the OpenAI dashboard at [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to access your API keys.

### Step 3: Generate an API Key

To create a new API key, go to the `API Keys` section, click on `+ Create new secret key`, and optionally name it in the pop-up. Once you click 'Create secret key', a unique alphanumeric API key will be generated. Be sure to store this key securely.

This API key works universally for all OpenAI models; you don’t need separate keys for each model.

### Step 4: Use the API Key in IntelliGeo

Copy your API key and input it when starting a new conversation within IntelliGeo. The key will be saved only in your local database; the IntelliGeo backend does not store or access your API key.

## Cohere Guide

### Step 1: Sign Up

Sign up for Cohere at [Cohere Signup](https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/register). You can register using your email address or an existing Google or GitHub account.

### Step 2: Access the Dashboard

Once logged in, go to the API Keys section to manage your API keys.

### Step 3: Create an API Key

To generate an API key, go to `API Keys`, then click `+ New Trial key`, optionally name it, and click 'Create secret key' to generate your unique API key. Make sure to store the key securely.

The Cohere API key works for all models, so you don’t need to create multiple keys.

### Step 4: Use the API Key in IntelliGeo

Copy your Cohere API key and input it when starting a new conversation in IntelliGeo. As with OpenAI, your key is stored locally and never accessed by IntelliGeo’s backend.

Once your API key is set up, you can start using the IntelliGeo plugin. Click on the IntelliGeo icon to open the chat interface. From there, you can chat and use the AI-powered geo-workflow features. Check out our video tutorial to get started:
