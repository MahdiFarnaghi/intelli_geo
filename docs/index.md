[IntelliGeo](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/intelli_geo/) is an innovative [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) plugin designed to bring the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the QGIS platform, making geospatial analysis more intuitive and efficient.

Currently in active development, the plugin's initial version `0.0.1` is compatible with QGIS versions `3.0.0` and higher.

## Funding

The development of IntelliGeo is part of the project titled "IntelliGeo: Laying the Groundwork for Integrating Large Language Models into GIS," funded by the Dutch Research Council ([NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en)) under the [AiNed](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/national-growth-fund/ained) program. This program aims to promote the development and application of AI within Dutch businesses and governmental institutions. The project is managed by the Geo-Information Processing Department at the Faculty of ITC, University of Twente, and is carried out in collaboration with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación ([BSC](https://www.bsc.es/)). Running from March 2023 to March 2024, the project seeks to revolutionize how geographical models are created by integrating advanced AI language models into open-source GIS tools.

The initiative's main goal is to develop tools that enable AI and human experts to collaboratively design sophisticated models for a variety of applications, including flood risk detection, crop yield estimation, and environmental change prediction.

## About the Plugin

IntelliGeo leverages **Large Language Models** to automate and simplify geospatial workflows within QGIS. 

Designed for GIS professionals, IntelliGeo assists users by automatically generating analytical models in the form of **PyQGIS scripts** or **workflows**, enabling efficient operation of QGIS software. This AI-powered tool reduces the need for extensive manual coding or model creation, enhancing productivity and simplifying complex geospatial analyses. By seamlessly integrating with QGIS, IntelliGeo allows users to design and execute complex geoprocessing tasks with ease.

### Key Features

- Seamless integration with the QGIS environment
- LLM-powered automation of geoprocessing workflows
- Collaborative modeling between AI systems and human experts

## The Repository

The IntelliGeo plugin is open-source, and its codebase is available on GitHub: [IntelliGeo Repository](https://github.com/MahdiFarnaghi/intelli_geo/)

This repository, maintained by the development team—[Mahdi Farnaghi](https://github.com/MahdiFarnaghi), [Gustavo García](https://github.com/chape1331), and [Zehao Lu](https://github.com/com3dian)—in collaboration with the community, serves as the hub for the IntelliGeo project. Here, users can access the source code, report issues, and contribute to ongoing development. 

The code is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/MahdiFarnaghi/intelli_geo/tree/main?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file), ensuring that the project remains open and accessible for future development and use.
