## Mahdi Farnaghi

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
Mahdi is an Assistant Professor at Geo-Information Processing Department Faculty ITC, University of Twente. His research is situated at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Geography, encompassing various areas of AI such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, data mining, linked data/semantic web, and planning/scheduling.
    
IntelliGeo was born out of discussions between Mahdi and Gustavo, with Mahdi serving as the Principal Investigator (PI) of the project. His focus includes conceptualizing the framework, leading the agentic design of IntelliGeo in relation to large language models (LLMs), and architecting the libraryâ€™s structure.
