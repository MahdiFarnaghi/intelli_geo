    <h3>Plugin Builder Results</h3>

    Congratulations! You just built a plugin for QGIS!<br /><br />

    <h3>What's Next</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In your plugin directory, compile the resources file using pyrcc5 (simply run <b>make</b> if you have
            automake or use <b>pb_tool</b>)
        <li>Test the generated sources using <b>make test</b> (or run tests from your IDE)
        <li>Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin directory (see Notes below)
        <li>Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager
        <li>Customize it by editing the implementation file <b>intelli_geo.py</b>
        <li>Create your own custom icon, replacing the default <b>icon.png</b>
        <li>Modify your user interface by opening <b>intelli_geo_dockwidget_base.ui</b> in Qt Designer
    </ol>
    Notes:
    <ul>
        <li>You can use the <b>Makefile</b> to compile and deploy when you
            make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake). The Makefile is ready to use, however you
            will have to edit it to add addional Python source files, dialogs, and translations.
        <li>You can also use <b>pb_tool</b> to compile and deploy your plugin. Tweak the <i>pb_tool.cfg</i> file
            included with your plugin as you add files. Install <b>pb_tool</b> using
            <i>pip</i> or <i>easy_install</i>. See <b>http://loc8.cc/pb_tool</b> for more information.
        <li>Hint: before compiling set the `QGISDIR` environment variable to your QGIS plugins folder. 
            <p>To find the path to the plugins folder, open QGIS and then go to Settings > User profiles > Open Active Profile Folder. In the explorer, the plugins folder can be found in python folder.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
